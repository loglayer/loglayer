# Vibe-coding prompts

99% of this code was vibe-coded using Cursor using the `claude-4-sonnet` model and in the agent `auto` mode.

These are the prompts utilized:

```text
Create a new context manager called IsolatedContextManager which does not copy context when a child logger is created. 
I've added a directory for this under packages/context-managers/isolated
```

```text
Create the full documentation in the docs dir
```
