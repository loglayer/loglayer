## 2.5.1

### Patch Changes

- [#264](https://github.com/loglayer/loglayer/pull/264) [`1038d13`](https://github.com/loglayer/loglayer/commit/1038d132169add199b1dbd6c7ada6d6fa7a86218) Thanks [@Eptagone](https://github.com/Eptagone)! - Improve typing for log context, metadata, and data objects

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#261](https://github.com/loglayer/loglayer/pull/261) [`9b32187`](https://github.com/loglayer/loglayer/commit/9b32187b1040f6331d0c21f666768da41d6c91a1) Thanks [@theogravity](https://github.com/theogravity)! - - Added new `raw()` method for advanced logging scenarios

  - Allows bypassing the normal LogLayer API to directly specify all aspects of a log entry
  - Supports complete control over log level, messages, metadata, error, and context
  - Still processes through all LogLayer features including plugins, context merging, and transport routing
  - See [Basic Logging documentation](https://loglayer.dev/logging-api/basic-logging.html#raw-logging) for usage examples

  - Fixed bug where `errorFieldInMetadata` option was not working correctly
    - Error objects were not being placed in metadata fields when `errorFieldInMetadata` was set to true
    - Now properly places errors in metadata fields as specified by the configuration

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#239](https://github.com/loglayer/loglayer/pull/239) [`12ca18a`](https://github.com/loglayer/loglayer/commit/12ca18ad65181fcbfc4c34d804ed875b691b895d) Thanks [@theogravity](https://github.com/theogravity)! - - Transports now additionally receive the `error`, `metadata`, and `context` data in the `shipToLogger()` callback. \* It is still recommended to use `data` for most use-cases as it is a merged object of all data with the user's configured fields.

  - Plugin callbacks `onBeforeDataOut()` and `shouldSendToLogger()` now additionally receive the `error`, `metadata`, and `context` data.

  This change should allow a plugin or transport developer to inspect data without needing to know how the user has configured their `data` object.
