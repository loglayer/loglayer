### Major Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/theogravity/loglayer/pull/13) [`d1a8cc2`](https://github.com/theogravity/loglayer/commit/d1a8cc21e4191547e839d334c9386e25f0410235) Thanks [@theogravity](https://github.com/theogravity)! - - Removes hooks and adds a plugin system where you can define multiple hooks to run instead.

  - Adds esm and cjs builds to the package

  **Breaking Changes**

  - The `hooks` option has been removed
  - The `setHooks()` method has been removed
  - A `plugins` option has been added
  - An `addPlugins()` method has been added

  _There will be a way to remove / disable specific plugins in a future release._

  **Migrating from 3.x to 4.x**

  Your 3.x definition may look like this:

  ```typescript
  {
    hooks: {
      onBeforeDataOut: ({ data }) => {
        // do something with data
        return data;
      },
      shouldSendToLogger: () => {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The 4.x version of this would look like this:

  ```typescript
  {
    plugins: [
      {
        onBeforeDataOut: (data) => {
          // do something with data
          return data;
        },
        shouldSendToLogger: () => {
          return true;
        },
      },
    ];
  }
  ```

  Type changes:

  - `LogLayerHooksConfig` -> `LogLayerPlugin`
  - `HookBeforeDataOutParams` -> `PluginBeforeDataOutParams`
  - `HookBeforeDataOutFn` -> `PluginBeforeDataOutFn`
  - `HookShouldSendToLoggerParams` -> `PluginShouldSendToLoggerParams`
  - `HookShouldSendToLoggerFn` -> `PluginShouldSendToLoggerFn`

  Summary:

  - Replace `hooks` with `plugins`
  - For your existing hooks, move them into the `plugins` array where each entry is an object with the hook definition

  See `README.md` for more details.

## 3.1.0

- Added new configuration option `muteContext` and `muteMetadata` to disable context and metadata logging.
- Added the following methods:
  - `LogLayer#muteContext()`
  - `LogLayer#unmuteContext()`
  - `LogLayer#muteMetadata()`
  - `LogLayer#unmuteMetadata()`

See readme for usage details.

Internal: Switch from `eslint` to [`biomejs.dev`](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting.

## 3.0.1

- Created a separate Typescript type for the `onBeforeDataOut` hook parameter, `OnBeforeDataOutParams`.

## 3.0.0

## 1.6.0 - Wed Mar 15 2023 13:25:45

**Contributor:** Theo Gravity

- Fix issue where `LogLayer#child()` was not creating a shallow copy of context (#10)

The documentation says the context should be shallow copied, but it wasn't. Now it is.

## 1.4.1 - Wed Nov 02 2022 05:06:51

**Contributor:** Theo Gravity

- Add support for creating child loggers (#9)

This adds a new method called `LogLayer#child()` that will create a new LogLayer instance with the original configuration and context data copied over.

**Contributor:** Theo Gravity

## 1.3.2 - Wed Aug 10 2022 02:24:37

**Contributor:** Theo Gravity

- Add `setHooks()` method (#5)

Adds a new method on `LogLayer` called `setHooks()` that allows
hooks to be set or updated after creation of the `LogLayer`.

Useful as an alternative to using configuration on init to set
a hook

## 1.3.1 - Wed Aug 10 2022 02:01:35

**Contributor:** Theo Gravity

- Add hooks feature, add onBeforeDataOut hook (#4)

This adds the ability to register hooks with `LogLayer`. The first available hook, `onBeforeDataOut()`, allows manipulation of the data object before it is sent to the logging library.

The data is now merged into the shared field.

## 1.1.1 - Mon Jun 13 2022 22:14:21

**Contributor:** Theo Gravity

- Add getContext() (#2)

Adds a new method to the transport, `getContext()`, which returns the current context.

## 1.0.1 - Mon Nov 29 2021 03:48:11
