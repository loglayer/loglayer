a hook

- Add hooks feature, add onBeforeDataOut hook (#4)

This adds the ability to register hooks with `LogLayer`. The first available hook, `onBeforeDataOut()`, allows manipulation of the data object before it is sent to the logging library.

If you configure the context and metadata fieldName to have the same name,

The data is now merged into the shared field.
