# Getting help from AI

LogLayer has support for the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) format.

To use it, add one of the links for your AI tool of choice:

- [/llms.txt](https://loglayer.dev/llms.txt) - Concise cheat sheet with examples
- [/llms-full.txt](https://loglayer.dev/llms-full.txt) - Full API reference

If you use Cursor, type `@doc` then choose "Add new doc", and use the /llms.txt or /llms-full.txt link.
