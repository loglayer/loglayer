# What's new in LogLayer

- [`loglayer` Changelog](/core-changelogs/loglayer-changelog)

## Feb 15, 2025

in `loglayer`:

- Added `clearContext()` to clear context data.
- `withMetadata()` / `metadataOnly()` / `withContext()` now allows an empty value. Empty values will not result in any data mutations or plugin executions.

## Feb 11, 2025

Major version 6 is out! ðŸŽ‰

This adds a new feature called [Context Managers](/context-managers/).

### Breaking Changes

- The `linkParentContext` configuration option has been removed. See the [migration guide](/migrating) for more information on how to replicate the functionality.

## Feb 8, 2025

- Added `linkParentContext` configuration option to allow child loggers to link to their parent's context. This enables changes to the context in either logger to affect both parent and child. [Learn more](./logging-api/child-loggers.html#shared-context-reference)
- The plugin method `runOnContextCalled` is no longer called during `child()` if context data exists as it'd be a redundant
  call.

## Feb 3, 2025

- Added a new method [`withFreshPlugins()`](/plugins/#replacing-all-plugins) to replace existing plugins with new ones in `loglayer`.

## Jan 27, 2025

- Added an integration doc for [Next.js](/example-integrations/nextjs) to show how to implement LogLayer with Next.js.
- Fixed the typings for `metadataOnly()` where the 2nd parameter should be optional.

## Jan 24, 2025

- Added a new method [`withFreshTransports()`](/logging-api/transport-management#replacing-transports) to replace existing transports with new ones in `loglayer`.

## Jan 20, 2025

- Plugin callbacks now pass the `loglayer` instance as the last parameter.
- Add the [Axiom.co Transport](https://loglayer.dev/transports/axiom).

## Jan 18, 2025

Add new options to the `ConsoleTransport`:

- `messageField`: Allows you to specify the field in the log message object where the message should be stored. This is useful when you want to log structured data and need to specify the field name for the message.
- `level`: Sets the minimum log level to process. Messages with a lower priority level will be ignored.

## Jan 17, 2025

- Added the [Log File Rotation Transport](https://loglayer.dev/transports/log-file-rotation) to write logs to files and rotate them
- Performance improvements around using multiple transports with `loglayer`

## Jan 15, 2025

- Added the [Filter Plugin](https://loglayer.dev/plugins/filter) for filtering log messages.
