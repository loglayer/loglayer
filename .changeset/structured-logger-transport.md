Added new built-in `StructuredTransport` - a console-based transport with structured logging enabled by default. Outputs logs as objects with `level`, `time`, and `msg` fields without requiring manual configuration. All field names are customizable. See the [Structured Logger Transport documentation](/transports/structured-logger) for usage examples.
