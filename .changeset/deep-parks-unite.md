New version 8 of LogLayer introduces [Log Level Managers](https://loglayer.dev/log-level-managers/), a system for managing log level settings across logger instances. Log level managers provide a way to control how log levels are inherited and propagated between parent and child loggers.

*v8 does not have any breaking changes; no migration steps are necessary to upgrade from v7 -> v8 of `loglayer`.*
