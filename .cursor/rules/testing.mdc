# Writing tests

## Unit testing

Unit tests are written using `vitest`.

## Transport tests

### Unit tests

If you are writing unit tests for a transport, then it's best to look at other transport unit tests for examples.

The transports are located in `packages/transports`, and the tests are found in their respective `src/__tests__` directory. The backing library for the transport tends to be mocked.

#### Running tests

You run tests with `pnpm run test`.

### Live tests

Live tests test the transport with the backing library (non-mocked). They are not unit tests. They are defined in `__tests__/livetest.ts` and mostly use `import { testTransportOutput } from "@loglayer/transport";` to test the transport.

It's recommended to look at other `livetest.ts` files for example implementations.
