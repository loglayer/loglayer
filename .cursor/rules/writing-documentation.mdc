# Writing documentation

Documentation consists of the following:

- A package-level `README.md` file.
- Documentation site files.

The documentation site is written using Vite Press. See the `project-structure.mdc` cursor rule file for
more information the documentation site folder structure.

- Sidebar configuration is defined in `docs/.vitepress/config.mts`.
- Any new additions to the project is marked in `docs/whats-new.md` with the current date and what has changed.

When documentation for a package is requested, we will need to create / update the `README.md` file, and then the documentation site file for it.

## Writing README.md documentation

The README.md for a package always has the following:

- An npm version badge
- A downloads badge
- A typescript badge
- A very simple description of what the package does and a link back to the LogLayer site documentation (https://loglayer.dev)
- A link to the corresponding site documentation

See other README.md files for examples of this.

The README.md should only contain how to install and setup the package using the bare minimum details necessary.
Deeper details / advanced configuration should be reserved for site documentation.

### Code examples

When writing the code example and you need to show logging usage after initial setup, make sure they are using LogLayer methods.

For example, do not do this:

```
// LogLayer does not support this!
log.info("hello world", { test: data })
```

It should be this:

```
log.withMetadata({ test: data }).info("hello world")
```

Likewise with errors:

```
// LogLayer does not support this!
log.error("hello world", new Error("test"))
```

It should be:

```
log.withError(new Error("test")).error("hello world")
```

The `id` configuration field on plugins and transports are always optional and should not be included in the code examples unless it is specifically required for the example to work.

## Importing LogLayer

In writing code samples, importing LogLayer looks like this:

`import { LogLayer } from 'loglayer';`

We do not have a `@loglayer/core`. Do not import LogLayer with that.

## Writing for the documentation site

When writing new documentation, refer to existing site documentation as past examples. For example, if I'm asking to write site documentation for a transport, then look at prior documentation for transports for a foundation.

- There should always be an npm version badge
- There should always be a link to the source for the package on GitHub
- Package install should always have examples for npm / yarn / pnpm. They should be presented in a group like existing documentation.
- Configuration should always be presented as a table.
- Code examples should always make sure to use LogLayer methods when using logging examples.

The package usually needs to be added to a list of sorts:

- `context-manager-list.md`: Context managers
- `plugin-list.md`: Plugins
- `transport-list.md`: Transports

And added to the documentation site sidebar config (`docs/.vitepress/config.mts`).
