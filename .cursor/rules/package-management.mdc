# Repo operations

## Package management

This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. You can run package-level scripts with `pnpm run <script>` such as `pnpm run test`.

## Project management

This project uses `turbo` to run package scripts.

- `turbo build` will build all packages in the project
- `turbo test` will run all tests in the project. Only use this if you mean to test all packages at once.
