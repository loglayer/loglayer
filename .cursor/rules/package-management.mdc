# Repo operations

## Package management

This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. You can run package-level scripts with `pnpm run <script>` such as `pnpm run test`.

## Project management

This project uses `turbo` to run package scripts.

- `turbo build` will build all packages in the project
- `turbo test` will run all tests in the project. Only use this if you mean to test all packages at once.

## Referencing project packages

If a new package uses a project package as a dependency or devDependency, use `workspace:*` for the version in the package.json entry since we use `pnpm` workspaces.

Example `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@loglayer/http-transport": "workspace:*"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "loglayer": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

Then run `pnpm i` to have them linked in the project.
