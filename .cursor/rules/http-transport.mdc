# Creating transports using the HTTP Transport

When creating a transport that calls an HTTP API, we should be using the HTTP Transport.

- Add the `@loglayer/transport-http` package
- The trans port config should extend `HttpTransportConfig`
- The transport should extend `HttpTransport`
- The `turbo.json` file should be copied from the logflare transport

## Documenting the transport

When creating the full documentation for the transport in `docs/`, it should include the HTTP Transport optional
configuration options using the partial `<!--@include: ./_partials/http-transport-options.md-->` after the transport
specific options.

Because the HTTP transport supports browser, server, deno, and bun, the corresponding transport should also have
those badges as well.

Add the `onDebug` and `onError` examples to the documentation as well.
