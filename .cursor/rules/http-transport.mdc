# Creating transports using the HTTP Transport

When creating a transport that calls an HTTP API, we should be using the HTTP Transport.

- Add the `@loglayer/transport-http` package
- The trans port config should extend `HttpTransportConfig`
- The transport should extend `HttpTransport`

## Documenting the transport

When creating the full documentation for the transport in `docs/`, it should include the HTTP Transport optional
configuration options using the partial `transports/_partials/http-transport-options.md` after the transport specific
options.
